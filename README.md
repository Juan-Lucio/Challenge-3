üìå Digital NAO Challenge ‚Äì Project Repository
üìñ Project Overview

The Digital NAO Challenge focuses on solving the problem of automating the integration of information about researchers and published articles at a university.
The solution retrieves data from the Google Scholar API and integrates it into the institution‚Äôs research database using Java (MVC) and MySQL.

Final deliverables:

PDF Report (analysis & results).

MP4 Video Presentation (visual storytelling).

Backlog & Roadmap (integrated into final submission).

üöÄ Project Sprints
Sprint 1

Research Google Scholar API.

Produce a technical report.

Initialize GitHub repository.

Create backlog and roadmap.

Sprint 2

Develop Java code for API GET requests.

Apply MVC design pattern.

Test and document code.

Update backlog & roadmap.

Sprint 3

Integrate API data into MySQL database.

Handle pagination & API errors.

Update backlog & roadmap with final results.

Final Submission

Deliver integrated solution.

Provide PDF + MP4 presentation.

Include final backlog & roadmap.

üìã Backlog
User Stories

As a researcher, I want my published articles to be automatically retrieved from Google Scholar, so that I don‚Äôt waste time updating them manually.

As a database administrator, I want the system to map retrieved data into the database structure, so that all information remains consistent.

As a project leader, I want clear documentation of the API usage, so that future developers can maintain and improve the solution.

As a developer, I want to implement the MVC architecture, so that the system remains modular and maintainable.

As a university staff member, I want a report and video presentation at the end, so that results can be communicated effectively to stakeholders.

Requirements List (Table 1)
User Stories	Requirements
Researcher wants auto-retrieved articles	Implement GET requests to Google Scholar API, handle pagination & errors.
Database admin wants structured data	Design DB schema, integrate JSON ‚Üí SQL mapping, ensure consistency.
Project leader wants documentation	Technical report of API endpoints, request examples, error handling notes.
Developer wants MVC modularity	Create Java classes for Model, View, Controller; separate logic properly.
Staff wants clear results	Produce final PDF report and MP4 presentation.
