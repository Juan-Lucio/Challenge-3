# Digital NAO Challenge – Researcher Data Integration

## 📌 Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to **automate the integration of researcher and publication data** at a university.  
By using the **Google Scholar API**, the system retrieves up-to-date information about researchers and their published articles and integrates it into the institution’s research database.  

This ensures **efficient management of research data** while reducing manual effort and errors.

## ⚙️ Key Functionalities
- **Retrieve data from Google Scholar API** (researchers and publications).  
- **Automated population of a MySQL database** with structured information.  
- **Implementation of the MVC design pattern** in Java for clean, modular code.  
- **Error handling and pagination** to manage large datasets.  
- **Documentation and final presentation** including backlog, roadmap, and reports.

## 🎯 Project Relevance
Universities and research institutions often struggle with **manual updates of researcher data**, which is:  
- Time-consuming.  
- Error-prone.  
- Difficult to keep synchronized with publications.  

This project provides an **automated and scalable solution**, improving data accuracy and reducing workload, while also strengthening the technical skills of the development team.
