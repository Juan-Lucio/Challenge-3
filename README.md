# üìö Digital NAO Challenge ‚Äì Research Data Integration

This project addresses the challenge of **automating the integration of information about researchers and published articles at a university**.  
Using the **Google Scholar API**, the system retrieves relevant data and integrates it into the institution‚Äôs research database, ensuring **efficient server/database interaction** and improved research data management.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Objective:** Automate the retrieval and integration of researcher and publication data.  
- **Technology:** Java, MVC architecture, Google Scholar API, MySQL Server 2022.  
- **Method:** Work is divided into **3 sprints** with a final integrated solution.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - PDF report (analysis + results).  
  - MP4 video presentation (visual storytelling).  
  - Finalized **backlog** and **roadmap**.

## üìÖ Project Roadmap

### Sprint 1
- Research Google Scholar API & produce a technical report.  
- Initialize GitHub repository.  
- Create **backlog** and **roadmap**.  

### Sprint 2
- Implement **Java GET requests** to Google Scholar Author API.  
- Apply **MVC design pattern**.  
- Test and document code.  
- Update backlog and roadmap.  

### Sprint 3
- Integrate retrieved API data into a **structured MySQL database**.  
- Handle pagination and API errors.  
- Update backlog and roadmap with final requirements.  

### Final Submission
- Deliver the **integrated solution**.  
- Provide:  
  - **PDF report** (analysis and results).  
  - **MP4 video presentation** (summary).  
  - **Backlog & Roadmap** (updated and included).

## üìã Backlog

### User Stories
1. As a researcher, I want my articles to be retrieved automatically, so I don‚Äôt update them manually.  
2. As a DB admin, I want API data mapped into the DB, so information stays consistent.  
3. As a project leader, I want API documentation, so future developers can maintain the solution.  
4. As a developer, I want MVC structure, so the system is modular and maintainable.  
5. As a staff member, I want a report & video, so results are presented effectively.  

### Requirements Tracking

**Table 1 ‚Äì Requirements List**

| User Stories | Requirements |
|--------------|--------------|
| Researcher needs auto-retrieval of articles | Implement GET requests, handle pagination/errors |
| DB admin wants data consistency | Design DB schema, JSON ‚Üí SQL integration |
| Leader wants documentation | Produce API technical report |
| Developer wants MVC | Implement Model, View, Controller classes |
| Staff wants final results | Produce PDF + MP4 presentation |

**Table 2 ‚Äì Prioritized Requirements**

| Requirements | Stage | Time Estimation | Deliverables |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
